   <p> The bitter and sweet experiences in oneâ€™s life are definitely going through on their own. For an eldest daughter like me, there are 
certainly many lifelong stories of love and grief that I have gone through for almost 21 years now. I was so happy to be raised in a very 
simple but loving family. For me, money is not everything but that love is actually real happiness. As the eldest child, of course, both 
parents really hope that their child will succeed. So I worked very hard to see both my mom and dad proud of what I got. </p>

  <p>I took the path of living in a dorm at the age of 13 so I was more focused on studying. At the age of 17 I finished high school by 
taking the SPM certificate. I also managed to continue my studies at the age of 18 to get a diploma certificate. Until now, I am very proud 
of myself for having made both of parents happy to see their daughter successfully continue her studies until today.<p>
